## Notes

test here are some more words
a couple more words here! what do we say? what do we do?
here are a couple of more adjus
- quiz app #idea/dev 
	- include back links?
	- Track new content since quiz?
- Indent plugin #idea/dev
	- Indents too small 
- Daily template #idea 
	- needs tasks to be fixed 
- **Gerrymandering / Proposition 50** #news
	- Politicians are reshaping voting districts across the country
	- Reshaping districts gives an advantage, because you can flip U.S. House seats from the opposing party to yours
	- **Texas** adopted a new map in August which could flip 5 Democratic seats to Republican
	- **California** followed suit, to flip 5 Republican seats Democratic
		- If passed, redistricting would take affect until the 2030 U.S. Consensus where the independent redistricting commission would redraw the map
		- The campaigning for **“No”** is less funded than the Newsom’s heavily campaigning for **“Yes”**. Not to mention, Democratic Party often leads by about 20% in California (4.5m voters)
	- Other states such as **Missouri** and **North Carolina** follow
	- Historically in midterms, president’s party loses seats, so this is Republicans’ way of getting ahead of that
	- Republicans control **219 seats** to Democrats’ **213**, with three vacancies
	- **Why is this significant this time around?**
		- Republicans want to make it impossible for Democrats to win back the house, mathematically, for the midterms
		- Democrats passing this proposition helps secure their chance at winning back the house
